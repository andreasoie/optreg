# TTK4135 - Optimization and Control

## Exercises

- [ ] **Day 1**: Repetition/introduction to use Simulink/QuaRC to control the helicopter. Familiarize yourselves with MATLAB/Simulink interaction.

- [ ] **Day 2**: Optimal control of pitch/travel with no feedback. An optimal input sequence that moves the helicopter 180 degrees should be calculated and implemented on the helicopter.

- [ ] **Day 3**: Optimal control of pitch/travel with feedback (LQ control). Feedback is introduced in the controller from part 2.

- [ ] **Day 4**: Optimal control of pitch/travel and elevation with feedback; that is, we have an optimal trajectory in two dimensions.

In all the exercises above you can assume that the pitch and the elevation controllers are “turned on” and that they are well tuned. We consider these controllers as inner control loops, and we will in the rest of the exercise use the setpoints to these two controllers (pc and ec) as manipulated variables (u(t)).

For each exercise, make sure you have done the section “Solve the following tasks before coming to the lab” (hereafter: prework) before arriving at the lab.

**It is possible to do the prework for all the exercises before finishing the “At the lab” sections.**
